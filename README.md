This project consists of two parts:

- The execution of an automated pipeline with Airflow and MlFlow.
- And an API in charge of making the predictions.

# Requirement

- AWS account with the enviroment variable AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
- AWS S3 bucket.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.

# Local deployment steps:

## Build the mlflow docker container

sudo docker build -t mlflow .

## Run docker-compose 

sudo AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' docker-compose up

# Airflow UI:
